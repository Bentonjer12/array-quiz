# array-quiz
Quiz we did to go over arrays.

# Instructions
## Part 1 (80 points):

Write a C# program that:

Creates an array of 10 integers

Asks the user 10 times to "Enter A Number:"

One-by-one accepts the user input
One-by-one puts the user input into your array
After all 10 numbers have been read in and added to the array, prints out all 10 numbers from the array.

Note: In order to get full credit for this part, you must use a loop to input the numbers and a loop to output the numbers.

## Part 2 (10 points):

Change your program so that it uses a foreach loop to output all the numbers.

## Part 3 (10 points):

Change your program so that it begins by asking the user how many numbers he/she would like to enter. However many numbers the user chooses to enter, prompt and input that many integers into an array. When done, print out all the numbers in the array.

## Deliverable
Submit a ".cs" file with your program in it. All of your code should be in Main().

Note: No error checking of any kind is required. You do not need to use any if statements or try / catch blocks. I will not test your program with bad data.

Note: If you do all of the parts of this quiz, you will still submit just one ".cs" file. That program should be one, seamless program. It should not have a "Part 1" section, a "Part 2" section, and a "Part 3" section. That is, your solution to Part 3 will probably overwrite or invalidate some of your Part 1 code. This is fine. If you are able to finish Part 3, even though it "removes" some of your Part 1 code, I will know that you were able to accomplish Part 1 even though some of the Part 1 code may be gone.
